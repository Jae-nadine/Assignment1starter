        <div class="p1"><p>Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, 
            including technology to elicit <strong>strong neural phase locking-</strong>
            allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated 
            activity-and technology to remove distraction in sound.
        <br>
        This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental 
        state. In other words, we've found new ways to create  music that helps you do 
        what you need to do. </p></div>
        <div class="p2"><p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions 
            to run experiments. <br>
            We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, 
            and also run large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on 
            simple games. <br>
            <strong>Our experiments always include a control condition ('placebo')</strong> 
            of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can 
            be sure our tech is what makes the difference.</p></div>
